# Feature documentation

`../features.md` remains ClosedRoom's canonical aggregate feature registry during the 0.8 baseline adoption. Do not duplicate the same behavior here.

Create a bounded file in this directory only when a feature has enough durable behavior, failure semantics, persistence/configuration or verification detail that splitting it materially improves agent context and ownership. Link the new file once from the aggregate registry and keep one canonical owner for each fact.
